# how would you use heirarchical trnsformer for VAEs for pose data?

To use a **hierarchical transformer in a VAE (Variational Autoencoder) for pose data**, you would design the encoder and decoder to process very long sequences of pose frames (like thousands per sample) by exploiting local and global structure in both the data and the temporal dependencies.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how this integration typically works:

## 1. **Input Representation**

- **Pose Frame Embedding:** Each frame's pose (e.g., joint coordinates) is mapped to a vector.
- **Positional Encoding:** Added to each frame-vector to retain sequence order information.


## 2. **Hierarchical Transformer Encoder**

- **Step 1: Chunking the Sequence**
    - Split a long pose sequence (e.g., 4,000 frames) into smaller segments or "chunks" (e.g., each chunk = 50 frames).
- **Step 2: Local Attention (First Level)**
    - Within each chunk, use a standard transformer block (self-attention + feedforward layers) to model detailed, short-term (local) relationships and interactions between frames in that chunk.
- **Step 3: Chunk Summarization**
    - Aggregate each chunk's output (e.g., using mean pooling, learned pooling, or an additional transformer block) into a summary vector that captures its key features.
- **Step 4: Global Attention (Second Level)**
    - Process the sequence of chunk summaries using another transformer layer, which models long-term dependencies across the entire sequence (i.e., from one chunk to another, so the model can learn about both local dynamics and global behaviors/actions).


## 3. **Latent Space (VAE Core)**

- **Flattened Output:** The top-level encoder produces a global summary of the input and feeds it into a dense layer(s) to predict the mean and variance of the latent variable.
- **Sampling:** The VAE samples from this latent distribution using the reparameterization trick.


## 4. **Hierarchical Transformer Decoder**

- **Latent Conditioning:** The decoder receives the sampled latent code (often concatenated or projected into per-chunk or per-frame representations).
- **Decoder Attention:** Typically mirrors the encoder structure:
    - **Top-Down Global Attention:** The latent code and (optionally) global structure guide the chunk-level generation.
    - **Per-Chunk Local Attention:** For each chunk, a transformer block generates detailed pose sequences, attending only to frames within that chunk.
- **Optional Masking:** In generative settings, the model can use masking to prohibit looking ahead in time (for autoregressive decoding).


## 5. **Loss Functions**

- **Reconstruction Loss:** Measures how well the reconstructed pose sequence matches the original.
- **KL Divergence:** Encourages a structured latent space.


## 6. **Summary Table: Components and Roles**

| Component | Role |
| :-- | :-- |
| Pose/Frame Embedding | Converts each frame into a vector |
| Positional Encoding | Encodes order in sequence/chunks |
| Local Attention (Encoder) | Models short-term relationships within each chunk |
| Chunk Pooling/Summarization | Aggregates chunks into single summary vectors |
| Global Attention (Encoder) | Models long-term patterns across chunk summaries |
| Latent Vector (VAE) | Captures sequence in compressed, generative representation |
| Decoder Local/Global Blocks | Reconstructs sequences chunk-by-chunk, using both local and global attention |
| Output Prediction | Generates pose for each frame |
| Loss Functions | Guides learning and regularizes latent space |

## **Benefits for Pose Data**

- **Scalability:** Handles long pose sequences (thousands of frames) efficiently.
- **Multi-scale modeling:** Learns both fine, short-range (micro-motion) and long, global (macro-motion, behavior) dependencies.
- **Better Latent Representations:** The hierarchical encoder yields strong global summaries for the latent code, while the decoder reconstructs detailed poses with guidance from global and local contexts.

**In practice:**
You implement a two-level transformer in both the encoder and decoder of your VAE. This lets the VAE model efficiently reconstruct and generate realistic human pose sequences, capturing everything from small gestures to large-scale movements, even in very long sequences. This approach is state-of-the-art for long sequential data such as human pose, video, or motion trajectories.
